In the past version of this course we used Matlab for these parts, but to avoid some installation/compatibility issues and make the exercises more accessible, this year we'll use IPython notebooks hosted on [github](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) and run by cloud-based service [colab](https://), directly from your browser.\n",

As you are running this notebook in colab, you can directly edit both (text and code) without worring to overwrite the original copy hosted on github. The easiest way to retain the changes you'll do is to save a copy of this notebook in your own drive through `File-> Save a copy in Drive`.\n"
